### Portal

- The portal works when wrapping the \_app.tsx file with the `components/Context/context.tsx` export
- I was able to get portals of images in their actual size to open in the DOM but it was only opening either (a) the first or last photo in the array or (b) all of the photos in the array. Additional config required.
